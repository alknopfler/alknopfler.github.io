During my career, I'm always looking for new technologies as well as looking for the way to improve the infrastructure as we know nowadays.

I've been working with infrastructure as code for a long time, using code to deploy and manage infrastructure. Some people, ask me a lot of questions about the concept infrastructure as code.

Infrastructure as code, or programmable infrastructure, means writing code (which can be done using a high level language or any descriptive language) to manage configurations and automate provisioning of infrastructure in addition to deployments. This is not simply writing scripts, but involves using tested and proven software development practices that are already being used in application development. For example: version control, testing, small deployments, use of design patterns etc. In short, this means you write code to provision and manage your server, in addition to automating processes.

I'll give you a very good explanation about infrastructure as code from my Thoughtworks collegues:
