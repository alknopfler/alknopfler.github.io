### Experiences Summary: 

- `Principal Telco Edge Engineer at SUSE` involve into the Telco Edge projects in order to develop the new Telco Edge Platform based on SUSE Edge stack. Working with RKE2/K3S, Rancher, Cluster API (CAPI), Metal3, Metallb, Multus (Calico, cilium, flannel), SRIOV, DPDK, OVS, K8s, 5G Telco workloads like FlexRan, and many other technologies in order to develop and integrate the new Telco Edge Platform.

- `Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat` involved in several projects doing integrations tasks for AssistedInstaller, ACM and OCP sub-products. Developing with Golang and operator-sdk the latency k8s operator for Telco customers integrating the solution into ACM placementrules.
Moreover, I've been working with Baremetal creating ZTPFW (Zero Touch Provisioning Factory Workflow) in order to deploy edge clusters without any manual interaction.

- `Software Architect Lead at Orange` defining the whole architecture as well as developing End2End solutions using event driven architectures with Kafka, golang microservices and Openshift/K8s. Moreover, the challenges for the project define the way to keep the operation and management fully automated in order to integrate new third parties to get the full End2End solution much more elastic and scalable than the Telco market has right now.

- `Cloud Architect Lead at BBVA Bank` working in the Global Platform Area. I’m developing Cloud Services on top of the Global Platform, leading the SWAT technical team in order to develop as fast as posible the Technical services which are cross to the Global Platform.

- `Cloud Computing & Innovation Engineer` I was involved in the deployment of the first banking private cloud based on Openstack and SDN (Nuage).

- `Cloud Computing & Security Engineer at Telefonica`  using security platforms and Cloud platform in order to define new cloud services based on Openstack and Amazon AWS.
