      <description>Few weeks ago, I wrote a post about my personal project for a Security Home Alarm System based on Golang, Raspberry PI and 433Mhz sensors ( see again here ).
After that, I thought that the next step for that project could be an Alexa Skill integration, in order to control and manage the Alarm System just with my voice.
This week, I bought a new Amazon Echo Dot, and today, the new functionality is ready to share with all of you ;)</description>

      <description>During my professional career, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with microservices for a long time, and I would like to share with you the experiences and knowledge that I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt working with them.
At the beginning, the first contact with microservice is like a piece of cake, but when you are getting deep under the hood, sometimes, you will be able to find some commons problems that you could solve just preparing your mind, your application and your infrastructure to be successfull in your tasks.</description>

      <description>Few months ago, I attended to an international OpenSource Event in Madrid in order to discuss, as an Engineer at BBVA, with other collegues (from other kind of companies) about the open source and the relevance of that philosophy for enterprises to change the culture to be more agile.
