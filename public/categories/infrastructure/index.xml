      <description>During my career, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for new technologies as well as looking for the way to improve the infrastructure as we know nowadays.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with infrastructure as code for a long time, using code to deploy and manage infrastructure. Some people, ask me a lot of questions about the concept infrastructure as code.
Infrastructure as code, or programmable infrastructure, means writing code (which can be done using a high level language or any descriptive language) to manage configurations and automate provisioning of infrastructure in addition to deployments.</description>
