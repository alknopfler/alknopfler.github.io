      <description>During my professional career, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with microservices for a long time, and I would like to share with you the experiences and knowledge that I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt working with them.
At the beginning, the first contact with microservice is like a piece of cake, but when you are getting deep under the hood, sometimes, you will be able to find some commons problems that you could solve just preparing your mind, your application and your infrastructure to be successfull in your tasks.</description>
