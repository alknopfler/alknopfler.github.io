During my professional career, quite unconsciously I have been going through different companies, learning and contributing to their culture, learning a lot about the way of working in the company, learning many facets from the professionals to complete my profile and improve day by day trying be a good professional and a better person.</p>
<p>As a result of this learning, I believe that an axiom has been forged in my profile that I have baptized it as &ldquo;Principle of Excellence&rdquo;. Surely it is something obvious to many people, or it is called in many other ways, but it is something that during the last year I have proposed to promote and that it is something that wherever I go I will try to offer as personal value for the company.</p>
<p><strong>Principle of Excellence</strong>:</p>
<p>1-. Always look for ways to improve your work. If you see that something can be improved, do what you can to improve it and make it excellent.</p>
<p>2-. A solution can be good, but it can always be improved. Seeking excellence should be your greatest goal. Seeking excellence does not explicitly mean being a perfectionist, although it may have a lot to do with it. On certain occasions where there are time compliance requirements, excellence can even be to reduce that time without losing the required quality. Perfectionism would mean ignoring the time requirement and seeking only the perfect solution, and that does not necessarily have to be the best. I always give an example to explain it. In some situations, the excellent solution is the one that simplifies a possible perfect solution without losing the minimum quality required.</p>
<p>3-. Never stay in what is expected of you as something normal. Always seek to be excellent and exceed your own expectations and goals. My parents instilled in me from school that I should always look towards those who do things better than me, and never look back. However, seeking constant improvement makes us better professionals but not necessarily better people. Look for reference people from whom you can learn to be better on a professional level and also on a personal level.</p>
<p>4-. Be humble and learn to openly acknowledge your mistakes. The human being is designed to err, and also to always improve based on the mistakes we have made before. Excellence is constantly looking for a way to keep learning from your mistakes. Sometimes mistakes can be corrected in time and other times you can only learn from them to avoid them in the future. Taking responsibility for wrong actions is something very important to learn during your professional career, despite the fact that sometimes a mistake is difficult to correct and you will only have to learn from the mistake so as not to make it more often.</p>
<p>5-. First you must be demanding with yourself to be able to ask others to be excellent. Lead by example of what you want to achieve. Excellence is something that is contagious and if you set an example of this, it will be easier for others to seek excellence in their professional and personal acts.</p>
