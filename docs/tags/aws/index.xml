      <description>Few weeks ago, I wrote a post about my personal project for a Security Home Alarm System based on Golang, Raspberry PI and 433Mhz sensors ( see again here ).
After that, I thought that the next step for that project could be an Alexa Skill integration, in order to control and manage the Alarm System just with my voice.
This week, I bought a new Amazon Echo Dot, and today, the new functionality is ready to share with all of you ;)</description>
